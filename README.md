# Frequency Hopping Radar Simulation
This project aims to develop a high-fidelity simulation environment to model radars and explore deep learning techniques for scheduling frequency hops in response to interference.

Working on implementing:
- simple radar returns with given target RCS, distance, operating frequency, etc.
- adversarial interference
- atmospheric attenuation in clear weather, rain, and fog

Future work:
- Implement scattering/multipath effects
- Use reinforcement learning to schedule frequency hops to counter jamming
